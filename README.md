## Logic Explanation

The game logic is implemented using ASP.NET WEBAPI. Here is a brief overview of the main components:

- **JogoController.cs**: Handles the game logic, uniting the Services. Not using Dependency Injection yet, it will be implemented.
  The game state will be stored in-memory within the JogoService. 
- **DeckService.cs**: Contains the Deck Requisitions, to get the deck and cards from decks.
- **JogoService.cs**: Manages the Game Logic.
